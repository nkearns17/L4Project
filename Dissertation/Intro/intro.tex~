\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

This project is "REPLACE WITH NAME OF APPLICATION", a revision tool for Level 2 Computing Science students. My client is Dr Jeremy Singer, a lecturer within the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. As well as my client, the Level 2 Computing Science students will also play a huge part in the developement of this application. Students are introduced to the Java programming language in Level 2 for the first time, and Dr Singer came up with the idea of creating an application for students to learn and practice their Java Programming skills.\\
\\
Dr Singer found that students with no prior knowledge of Java struggle to grasp the basic Java syntax and concepts, and hopes that by providing the students with a learning application this will help them to become familiar and confident with their programming skills. Providing an alternative learning and revision tool for the students will allow them to practice Java at anytime they feel necessary, throughout the course and even in later years to recall syntax or concepts they may have forgotten, and not have to rely soley on the material provided by the university. Through the use of interactive tutorials, which the students can work their way through, and quizzes to test their knowledge, the idea is to make the application enjoyable and easy for the students to revise with.
